# The Plan

Well, python is becoming more popular amongst data scientists and statististicians and I decided to redo all of my homework from my previous statistics classes in python. This will help give me a refresher at the same time improve my python programming skills. I hope whoever looks at this enjoys parsing through random R/Python code.
